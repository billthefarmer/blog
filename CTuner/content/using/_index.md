Play your instrument into your microphone and observe the display. The
oscilloscope display at the top shows the input waveform. The display
below shows the spectrum of the input. It may be zoomed in and out by
clicking on the pane. When zoomed in the display shows about

notes within that range.

The numeric display shows the note, deviation in cents, correct
frequency, actual frequency, reference and frequency deviation. The

whether the input note is flat or sharp. The alternative staff display
