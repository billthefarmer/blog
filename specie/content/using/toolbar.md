  pop up. Touch an entry to add it or touch the **Cancel** button

  is selected others may be added or removed from the selection by
  touching them. Another long touch on another currency will clear the
  list and select the new currency. Touch the **Clear** button to
  clear the selection. Touch the **Select** button to add the
  selection. The entries will be added to the list in the order
  selected.
* **Refresh** Get the day's currency rates from [Floatrates][1]. The date
  shown on the left above the currency list will be updated if new
  rates are available. It may show the previous day because the rates
  are updated at around 14:15 CET. The status display on the right
  above the currency list will show 'OK', 'No Connection', 'No WiFi'
  or 'Roaming' according to the update settings. It may show 'Failed'
  if the connection times out or fails to connect.
