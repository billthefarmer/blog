  one or two currencies from the list as above to replace the current
  currencies in the chart.

* **Historical** The chart will be updated with nearly eighteen years
  of historical data currently dating from 1 January 1999. Not all the

  while, depending on the connection, and will download more than 6Mb
  of data.
* **Range** Change the chart range. The chart will show the latest
  data, but will scroll back. **Note** &ndash; ranges greater than a
  quarter will have no effect unless the chart is updated with the
  historical data.
  * **Week** &ndash; One week
  * **Month** &ndash; One month
  * **Quarter** &ndash; Three months
  * **Year** &ndash; One year
  * **5 Years** &ndash; 5 Years
  * **Max** &ndash; Maximum current range
