Touch the current currency value field to edit the value. The display
will be updated dynamically as you type. Touch the **Done** button on
the numeric keypad to update the value field.  The whole value field
is selected by default when touched so it will be overwritten by
typing in a new value. To deselect the text, touch an adjacent area,
like the currency flag.
