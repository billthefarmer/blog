    content: "I am retired, a morris musician and an itinerant
    developer. I was a chartered electrical engineer until I stopped
    paying for a journal I couldnâ€™t understand. Over the course of a
    long career working for the local electrick light company I
    developed various bits and pieces of software in so many different
    languages I can no longer remember them all."
