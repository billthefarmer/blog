A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some letters
in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and two
spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place by
tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the bottom
spectrum. The **Reset** button will restore the default colours, The
**Cancel** button changes nothing, and the **OK** button accepts the
changes.
