A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some letters
in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and three
spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place by
tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the middle
spectrum. Change the shade of grey of the letters not in the word with
the bottom spectrum. The **Reset** button will restore the default
colours, The **Cancel** button changes nothing, and the **OK** button
accepts the changes.
