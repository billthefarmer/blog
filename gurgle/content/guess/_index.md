Tap letters on the keyboard to enter a guess. Use the **Back** key to
backspace. You may use an external keyboard. Letters may also be
entered by tapping a slot to select, then tapping a letter. This can
also be used to change letters. When you have finished a guess, tap
the **Enter** key. If you have guessed the word correctly, a fanfare
will play and a short message will appear. Tap the word for it's
definition.
