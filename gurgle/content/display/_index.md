Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
yellow. If they are in the right place they will turn green. If they
are not in the word they will turn grey. Keep trying until you have
guessed the word. The display will scroll up if you run out of
guesses. The colours may be changed by selecting **Highlight colours**
in the menu.
