### Code
Enter the code shared by another copy of Gurgle to set the same
sequence of words. Tap the refresh button to start the new
sequence. You may also make up your own code. It doesn't need the two
equals symbols on the end ('='), but will fail with just one.

### QR code
Opens the camera app on the phone to take a photo of a QR code. The
app will attempt to decode it. There are plenty of very good QR code
and barcode scanner apps that do a better job.

### Receiving a code
If the app is sent a code or a QR code image it will set a new
sequence of words if the code is decoded successfully. This does not
affect the current game. Tap the refresh button to start the new
sequence.
