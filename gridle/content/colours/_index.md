Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
yellow. Remember this can be in both directions. If they are in the
right place they will turn green. If they are not in the word they
will turn grey. Keep trying until you have guessed all the the
words. The colours may be changed by selecting **Highlight colours**
in the menu.
