You may add custom styles to the markdown formatting by placing a
`styles.css` file in the `Diary/css` folder, which will replace the
built in styles file which simply limits the width of images to the
page width. Use the built in editor to create a styles file. You must
use the editor `accept` tick button to save the edits.

**Caution** &ndash; There is no such thing as a markdown syntax error, but
syntax errors in a styles file may cause unpredictable results and
affect all diary pages. See
[CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Css).

You may include the built in styles file with an `@import` statement
`@import "file:///android_asset/styles.css";` or
`@import url("file:///android_asset/styles.css");`, which should be on
the first line.
