You may add an event to the calendar by adding a line to a diary entry
which begins with an at symbol (@) followed by a time and an event
title `@ 10:30 Dentist`. An event will be added to the calendar when
the entry is saved. A colon will be added after the 'at' symbol when
the event has been added `@:10:30 Dentist`. Use the Calendar app to
remove or edit events. Do not remove the colon from the diary entry or
the event will be added again. You may add events from the calendar to
the current diary entry. Events will be added from the relevant
calendar date.
