You may put links in diary pages, so
`[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)` will show a link to
DuckDuckGo. Links will be followed if touched. Use the back button in
the toolbar or the navigation bar to return to the diary page. Links
to other diary pages may either be a relative reference to the entry
file `[Sunday](25.txt)`, or use a date URI
`[Whenever](date:17/10/2017)`. Use your local convention for short
form numeric dates (UK: `dd/mm/yyyy`, US: `mm/dd/yyyy`). Use the back
button to return. The back button may be used to retrace your path
through diary entries and external web pages. Use the **Today** button
to clear the navigation entries.
