Diary doesn't support [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
but it is possible to use an external site to add LaTeX formatted
images.

    ![Math](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}
        &bc=cornsilk&fc=black&im=jpg&fs=24&ff=arev)

    \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}

 ![Math](images/Latex.png)

If you don't intend to change the image, you can copy it and use that
instead, which will then work offline.
