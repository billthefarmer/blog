There is a [help][1], a [test][2], an example [styles][3] file and an
example [script][4] file, which may be copied in to an entry for
reference if required.

You may put a link to the embedded [help
file](file:///android_asset/help.md),
`[Help](file:///android_asset/help.md)` in an entry. Selecting it will
load a copy into the markdown view. Long touch on a word and choose
**Select all** on the pop up menu. Select **Share**, and **Diary** in
the Share dialog. Choose a date in the date picker, and you will have
a copy in the chosen entry.
