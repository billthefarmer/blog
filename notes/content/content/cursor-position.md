You may put a line in a note to control or remember the edit cursor
position. This will not appear in the markdown view. Put `[<]: #` on a
line for the start of an note, `[>]: #` for the end of a note. Put
`[#]: #` for the cursor position to be remembered. There should be no
other text on the line. The current cursor position will be added when
the note is saved `[#]: # (nnn)`. Because notes are only saved if they
are changed, moving the cursor with no other change will not move the
saved position.
