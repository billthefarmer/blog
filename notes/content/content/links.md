You may put external links in notes, so
`[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)` will show a link to
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). Links will be followed if
touched. Use the back button in the toolbar or the navigation bar to
return to the note. Links to other notes may added as a relative
reference `[AnotherNote](AnotherNote.md)`.
