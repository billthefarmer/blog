You may use a note template. If a template is set it will be copied to
a new note. A date code &ndash; `<<date>>` may be inserted into the
template which will be converted into the current date and
time. Alternatively a date pattern may be added to the code &ndash;
`<<date EEEE d MMMM yyyy HH:mm>>` for a custom date format. See
[here][1] for the pattern documentation.
