You may use a template for new note names. If a template is set it
will be used for the name of new notes. A date code &ndash; `<<date>>`
may be inserted into the template which will be converted into the
current date and time. This will default to `yyyy/MM/dd-HHmmss`, which
will expand to `2022/02/20-113052`, so `<<date>>.md` will give
`2022/02/20-113052.md`. This gives a hierarchical folder structure
similar to my [Diary](https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary)
app. Alternatively you may use your own date pattern for a custom
name, as below in [Template][1].
