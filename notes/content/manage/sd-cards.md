Android allows removable SD cards to be used like a USB stick or as
part of the device storage. Notes opened using the chooser on a
removable SD card may not save successfully using the save button. Use
the **Save as** menu item and the **Storage** button to save it using
the android file manager. Alternatively use the **Storage** button on
the chooser dialog to open the Note using the android file
manager. The file manager may refuse to open some types of text files
not recognised by android.
