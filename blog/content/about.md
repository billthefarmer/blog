Playing at Oldland Mill, near Ditchling.

I am retired, a morris musician and an itinerant developer. I was a
chartered electrical engineer. Over the course of a long career
working for the local electrick light company I developed various bits
and pieces of software in so many different languages I can no longer
remember them all. In rough order they are:

   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---
6800 assembler|DEC Macro|Fortran|6502 assembler|Basic, various flavours
Forth|8051 assembler|BCPL|Lisp|C
PL1|IBM JCL|68000 assembler|Java|[Smallworld Magik][1]
JavaScript|haXe|PHP|Python|C++

Lately I have written various Android apps and a WordPress plugin. I
play music for the [Thakeham Morris][2] side, and also occasionally
take part in local pub music sessions. Unlike just about every other
local musician I know, I&rsquo;m not in a ceilidh band. I hate
ceilidhs.
