Lunch for two.

## Ingredients

  * 4 bell peppers
  * 1/2 cup cous cous
  * 6-8 slices chorizo cut into four pieces
  * 2-3 cloves garlic, sliced
  * small onion, chopped
  * 1/4 vegetable stock cube
  * 1/2 tsp paprika
  * 1/2 tsp oregano
  * boiling water
  * olive oil

## Method

  1. Trim the stems of the peppers, cut the tops off, and remove the seeds and pulp from inside.
  2. Cover the bottom of a small pan with oil and add the garlic, onion, chorizo, paprika and oregano, place on a gentle heat and cook until the onions are transparent.
  3. Add the cous cous and the stock cube, crumbled, stir to mix it together and allow to cook for another few minutes. You should begin to notice a toasted cous cous aroma.
  4. Add half a cup of boiling water and turn off the heat. Put the lid on and let it sit until the water has been absorbed. Stir it up and add a bit more hot water.
  5. Arrange the peppers in a tin so they hopefully don&#8217;t fall over.
  6. Spoon the mixture into the peppers and put the lids back on.
  7. Put in a medium hot oven (175 Â°C) for about 20 minutes.
  8. Serve with salad or bread.
