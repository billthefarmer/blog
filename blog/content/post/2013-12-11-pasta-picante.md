We ate this in the Restaurante Terraza del Mar along the coast path from Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife. This is my adaptation. Light lunch for two.

### Ingredients

  * Pasta for 2, whatever you like
  * Small fresh chilli
  * Small onion
  * Couple of cloves of garlic
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  * Oregano
  * Olive oil
  * Anything else you fancy, we put some grated carrot in ours

### Method

  1. Cook the pasta in boiling water and drain when done.
  2. Meanwhile warm up a large skillet or frying pan with a small amount of olive oil in it.
  3. Chop up the chilli, onion and garlic and put in the pan.
  4. Grind some black pepper over the pan.
  5. Sprinkle oregano over the pan, and put a lid on, if you have one.
  6. When the chilli, onion, etc are cooked nicely, pour over the drained pasta.
  7. Give it a good shake and stir to cover the pasta with the oil and vegetables.
  8. Serve in warmed bowls with some crusty bread.
