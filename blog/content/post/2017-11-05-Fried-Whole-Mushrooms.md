Just a more interesting way of preparing mushrooms than chopping them up.

### Ingredients
 * Mushrooms
 * Olive oil

### Method
 1. Keep the mushrooms whole, even if they have long stems. Put some
    oil in a skillet over a medium heat and place the mushrooms cap
    down in the pan with the stems sticking up.
 2. Add a couple of drops of oil to the inside of the cap of each mushroom.
 3. When the caps are browned tip them on their sides or turn them
    over depending on the length of the stems.
 4. When done serve on toast or however you like your mushrooms.
