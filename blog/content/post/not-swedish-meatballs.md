Meatballs are sometimes on offer at our local supermarket, so what can
you do with them apart from meatball curry or meatballs with
spaghetti? What about swedish meatballs? Well we didn't like the sound
of the creamy gravy or sauce they are supposed to be served with and
decided that [Truly Evil Onion Gravy][1] was the way to go.

### Ingredients

 * Meatballs
 * Frozen or fresh peas
 * [Truly Evil Onion Gravy][1]

### Method

 1. Start the gravy first as it takes a while to render the onions down.
 2. Once the onions are well done, fry the meatballs gently in a
    skillet, turning them so as to brown all over.
 3. Cook the peas in accordance with the instructions. When they are
    done, use the cooking water for the gravy, first pouring it into
    the skillet to get any burnt on bits.
  4. Serve, pouring the gravy over the faggots and peas.
