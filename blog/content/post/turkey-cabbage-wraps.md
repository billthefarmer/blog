Our neighbour has been giving us large kale&ndash;like leaves from his
purple sprouting broccoli plants, which are quite tasty. I decided to
look up what could be done with large cabbage leaves and decided on
wraps with a tomato sauce over the top.

## Ingredients
 * 250g minced turkey thigh
 * An onion, finely chopped
 * A garlic clove, crushed
 * A carrot, grated
 * 50g porridge oats
 * Small stick of celery, chopped
 * A mushroom, chopped finely
 * An egg
 * Black pepper
 * Olive oil
 * Enough cabbage leaves for six wraps
 * A jar of pasta sauce or tin of chopped tomatoes
 * Grated cheese for topping
 
## Method
 1. Cut the tough stems out of the leaves and cook them gently in just
    enough water until limp enough to wrap around the ingredients.
 2. Put some olive oil, the onions, garlic, carrot, celery and
    mushrooms in a medium skillet and cook gently, covered, until
    looking done, then add the oats and cook a bit more.
 3. In a large bowl crack the egg, grate over some black pepper, and
    whip until combined.
 4. Add the turkey, wait for the veg mixture to cool down, then add it
    to the bowl.
 5. Mix it all up until well combined.
 6. Lay out each leaf on a chopping board or similar, put a large
    heaped tablespoon of turkey mixture on each one, and roll it
    up. If the leaves are wide enough, tuck the sides in before
    rolling. You may need two leaves for each wrap if they are long
    narrow ones. You should end up with six wraps.
 7. Place the wraps in a suitable casserole dish and cover with sauce
    or chopped tomatoes. Grate some cheese over the top.
 8. Cook in a medium oven for about 40 minutes until the sauce is
    bubbling and the cheese is melted and browning.
