Back in the mid 70&#8217;s, I had to do some work at Kingston upon Thames Power Station. When I stopped for lunch, I found a little Greek restaurant opposite in a parade of shops and restaurants. That whole area, including the power station has since been redeveloped, and bears no resemblance. I had their lunch time offer of pan fried kidneys, probably with rice.

When I got home, I mentioned this to she who did most of the cooking at that time and she came up with something which became her kidney special. It evolved into a completely different dish over time.

I looked for some lamb&#8217;s kidneys in the co-op today, but ended up with liver instead. A tasty meal for two.

## Ingredients

  * Approx 240g sliced lamb&#8217;s liver
  * A couple of rashers of streaky or cooking bacon
  * Approx 50g of sliced chorizo
  * An onion, sliced
  * Olive oil for cooking

## Method

  1. Cover the bottom of a large skillet or frying pan with oil and place onion slices in the pan.
  2. Cook on a low heat until softened and starting to brown and turn over.
  3. Place the slices of liver on top and arrange the bacon and chorizo around the liver.
  4. Cover and cook on the low heat until the liver is nearly cooked through.
  5. Turn the slices of liver over, and cook for another minute or so.
  6. Serve with mashed potato or rice.
