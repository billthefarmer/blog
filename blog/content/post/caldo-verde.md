This is not the traditional method of making caldo verde. The cabbage
should something like spring greens, collard greens or cavalo
nero. Spinach beet works also. Roll up the leaves and slice thinly.

Delicious lunch for two.

### Ingredients

 * Olive oil
 * Two or three green cabbage or kale leaves, sliced thinly
 * A medium onion, chopped
 * Two or three cloves of garlic, chopped
 * A medium sized potato, preferably floury type, chopped into cubes
 * About half a dozen slices of chorizo, chopped into small pieces and
   another half dozen slices left whole
 * Half of a vegetable stock cube
 * Milk

### Method

 1. Cover the bottom of a small saucepan with olive oil and place on a
    low heat
 2. Add the chopped chorizo and allow to warm up until bubbling merrily
 3. Add the onion and garlic, the stock cube, the potato, and the
    cabbage/kale on top
 4. Cover and allow to steam until the potatoes mash easily with a fork
 5. Add milk to cover and mash most of the potato with the fork
 6. Allow to warm through until the milk starts to froth
 7. Meanwhile, warm up the chorizo slices in a small skillet over a
    gentle heat
 8. Season to taste and ladle into bowls, add the slices of chorizo
    and oil from the skillet on top
 9. Serve with toast or crusty bread
