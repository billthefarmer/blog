This is not the traditional method of making caldo verde. The cabbage
should something like spring greens, collard greens or cavalo
nero. Roll up the leaves and slice thinly.

Delicious lunch for two.

### Ingredients

 * Olive oil
 * Two or three green cabbage or kale leaves, sliced thinly
 * A medium onion, chopped
 * Two or three cloves of garlic, chopped
 * A medium sized potato, preferably floury type, chopped into cubes
 * About half a dozen slices of chorizo, chopped into small pieces and
   another half dozen slices left whole
 * Milk

### Method

 1. Cover the bottom of a small saucepan with olive oil and place on a
    low heat
 2. Add the chopped chorizo and allow to warm up until bubbling merrily
 3. Add the onion and garlic, the potato, and the cabbage/kale on top
 4. Cover and allow to steam until the potatoes mash easily with a fork
 5. Add milk to cover and mash most of the potato with the fork
 6. Season to taste and ladle into bowls, add the slices of chorizo on top
 7. Serve with toast or crust bread
