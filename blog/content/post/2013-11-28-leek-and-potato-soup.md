A vegetable soup thatâ€™s full of flavour. Make it into a meal with plenty of bread and butter. Enough for two, double the recipe for four.

#### Ingredients

  * 1 tbsp olive oil
  * 1 onion, chopped
  * 125g/4oz potatoes, cubed
  * 1 medium leek, chopped
  * 1 clove garlic, crushed
  * 1/2 a fresh chilli, if desired
  * 1 small carrot, grated
  * 350ml/3/4 pint milk and water
  * salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Preparation method
  1. Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onions, garlic, carrot, potatoes and leeks. Cook for 3-4 minutes until starting to soften.
  2. Add the milk and water and bring to the boil. Season well and simmer until the vegetables are tender.
  3. Whizz with a hand blender or in a blender until most of the vegetables have been liquidised, but leave some lumps of vegetables for a more interesting texture.
