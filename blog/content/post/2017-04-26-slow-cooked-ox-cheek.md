Ox cheek is a tasty cut of beef, but it contains tough connective tissue which melts away when slow cooked.

### Ingredients

  * 4-6 chopped onions
  * 3-4 large carrots
  * Olive oil
  * Black pepper
  * Bay leaves

### Method

  1. Put ox cheek in slow cooker and set to high heat
  2. Put a couple of bay leaves in the pot, grind black pepper over the meat and pour some olive oil over it
  3. Surround the meat with chopped onions and chopped carrots
  4. Put on the lid and allow to cook for a while
  5. When bubbling melted down onion and meat juices become visible around the meat, turn the heat down to low
