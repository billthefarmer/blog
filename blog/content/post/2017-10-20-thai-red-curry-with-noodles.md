This is rather unconventional, but we like it as a change from fried
rice. Lidl conveniently stock the red curry paste, coconut milk and
Chinese noodles. Enough for four.

### Ingredients

 * 2 or 3 garlic cloves, chopped
 * 2 or 3 large onions, chopped
 * 2 or 3 carrots, grated
 * 2 or 3 tomatoes, chopped
 * Whatever green veg is to hand, green, red, or white cabbage, chopped
 * Mushrooms, chopped, if available
 * Chicken, pork, fish, or whatever is available, chopped
 * 1/2 packet Chinese noodles
 * 1/3 jar red curry paste
 * 1 tin coconut milk
 * 1 tbsp olive oil

### Method

 1. Place the onions, garlic, carrots, green veg and meat in a wok with the olive oil over a low heat.
 2. Cover with a tray or similar, and allow to steam until the veg is soft and the meat is cooked through, if raw.
 3. Add the curry paste and tin of coconut milk, and give it a good stir and allow to simmer until everything is cooked.
 4. Meanwhile, place the noodles in a large pan and boil a kettle of water.
 5. When the kettle has boiled, pour boiling water over the noodles, and put over a medium heat.
 6. When the noodles start to simmer, turn the heat down and separate the noodles with a fork.
 7. When the noodles are done, drain in a colander, place in bowls, and spoon over the curry and sauce.
 8. Enjoy.
