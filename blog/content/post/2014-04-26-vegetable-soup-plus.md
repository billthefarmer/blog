<header>A vegetable soup with a bit of meat thatâ€™s full of flavour. Similar to leek and potato soup recipe. Make it into a meal with plenty of bread and butter. Enough for two, double the recipe for four.</header> 

### Ingredients

  * 1 tbsp olive oil
  * 1 onion, chopped
  * 1 small potatoe, cubed
  * 1 clove garlic, crushed
  * 1/2 a fresh chilli, if desired
  * Additional vegetables as available: grated carrot, leek, courgette, cabbage, etc
  * a few slices of chorizo or other tasty sausage, chopped
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  * Milk

## Method

  1. Heat the oil in a large pan and add the vegetables and sausage. Cook for 3-4 minutes until starting to soften.
  2. Grind over some black pepper.
  3. Add the milk and heat gently until it is about to boil. Simmer until the vegetables are tender.
  4. Whizz with a hand blender or in a blender until most of the vegetables have been liquidised, but leave some lumps of vegetables and sausage for a more interesting texture.
