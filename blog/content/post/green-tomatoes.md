If you grow your own tomatoes outside you will end up with green ones
that aren't going to ripen up anytime soon. The classic method for
using them up is to make Green Tomato Chutney, which is quite easy. If
the skins are tough, use a blender to liquidise them.

## Green Tomato Chutney
### Ingredients

 * 175g/6oz light brown sugar
 * 150ml/5fl oz red wine vinegar
 * 1 shallot or small onion, peeled, finely chopped
 * 1 garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped
 * 2cm/¾in piece fresh root ginger, peeled, finely grated
 * 1 red chilli, finely chopped
 * 125g/4½oz sultanas
 * 600g/1lb 5oz green tomatoes, quartered

### Method

 1. Heat the sugar in a frying pan until the sugar melts and caramelises.
 2. Add the white wine vinegar, shallot, garlic, ginger, chilli,
    sultanas and green tomatoes and bring the mixture to the
    boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour, or until the chutney
    has thickened and you can draw a wooden spoon across the base of
    the pan so that it leaves a channel behind it that does not
    immediately fill with liquid.
 3. Spoon the chutney into sterilised jars.

They can also be used in recipes that require ripe tomatoes with the
addition of some tomato puree, such as [Catalan slow cooked
chicken][1].
