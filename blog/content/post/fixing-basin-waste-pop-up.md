There are two things that seem to go wrong with pop up basin waste
plugs, either the clicker stops working or the O ring washer fails.

### Clicker

![Clicker][1]

The clicker can stay stuck down, refuse to stay down or come apart.

If it sticks down it can possibly be pulled back up with a drain
plunger, otherwise you will need to take off the U bend and poke it
back up with a long screwdriver. To take it out, unscrew the plug from
the top and use a small adjustable spanner to remove the clicker. It
will be choked up with sludge and hair, clean it out and put some
petroleom jelly on it for lubrication. It should then work again.

If it refuses to stay down, the internal grooves for the mechanism are
probably worn. You will need to get a new one. See above for how to
take it out.

If it comes out completely, the small retaining screw has probably
fallen out. You will need to take off the U bend and attempt to rescue
any bits that have dropped down. If you can find all the bits, it is
possible to reassemble it, you need a pair of long nosed pliers, or
something similar to get the piece of bent wire back in it's hole at
the bottom end. Otherwise, get a new one.

Replacement clickers can be found on [eBay][3], make sure you get the
right type, there's more than one.

### Washer

![Plug][2]

I have found it asmost impossible to get the correct replacement O
ring type washer for the pop up plug. The only ones I found that might
be correct cost more than the whole basin waste assembly complete. I
ended up with some 38mm O rings from [Amazon][4] that weren't quite
fat enough, so I fitted two of them, which seems to work.
