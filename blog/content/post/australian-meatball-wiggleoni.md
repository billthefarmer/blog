This is an adaptation of a recipe by our daughter's Australian
fiancee. His version was a way of getting vegetables into his kids by
hiding them in meat sauce. This adaptation uses meatballs instead of
mince.

### Ingredients

 * Meatballs
 * Tomatoes, chopped
 * Tomato paste
 * Olive oil
 * Oregano
 * Onions, chopped
 * Garlic, chopped
 * Carrots, chopped
 * Celery, chopped
 * Cabbage, chopped
 * Fusilli pasta

### Method

 * Fry or cook the meatballs in the oven, keeping them warm.
 * Make a tomato and vegetable sauce with the olive oil, tomatoes,
   tomato paste, oregano and vegetables. Use either fresh tomatoes or
   a tin of tomatoes. Use any vegetables that take your fancy.
 * Cook the pasta in accordance with the instructions on the packet.
 * Either put the meatballs in the sauce or put them on top of the
   pasta in the serving bowls with the sauce on top.
