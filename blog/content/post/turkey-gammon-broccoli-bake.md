This is a recipe for using up a Christmas turkey or chicken, gammon
joint, veg etc. You will need a large saucepan for the veg and pasta,
a small saucepan for the sauce and a casserole dish or similar to bake
it in.

### Ingredients

 * Cooked turkey/chicken, chopped
 * Cooked gammon, chopped
 * Broccoli, cut into florets
 * Any other veg that needs using
 * Penne pasta
 * Cheddar or Red Leicester cheese
 * Plain flour
 * Onion, chopped
 * Garlic, chopped
 * Celery, chopped
 * Black pepper
 * Dried oregano
 * Olive oil
 * Milk

### Method
#### Meat, Broccoli and Pasta
 1. First cook the broccoli and any other veg in a large saucepan in
    the minimum of water. You will need enough veg to about half fill
    the dish you want to cook it in.
 2. While this is cooking, arrange the meat in the cooking dish, you
    will need enough to cover the bottom.
 3. When the veg is cooked reserve the cooking liquid and arrange the
    veg on top of the meat.
 4. Use the same saucepan to cook the pasta. You will need enough to
    fill up the other half of the cooking dish when cooked.
#### Cheese Sauce
 5. While the pasta is cooking cover the bottom of a small saucepan
    with olive oil and add chopped onion, garlic, celery, black pepper
    and oregano.
 6. Cook the onions, etc over a low heat until the veg turns soft and
    add about a heaped tablespoon of flour and stir it up. You will
    probably need to add more oil, or it will be too dry.
 7. Add the reserved veg cooking liquid and enough milk to half fill
    the pan. Keep stirring to stop it catching on the pan and add more
    milk as necessary.
 8. Add the cheese, chopped into small pieces and stir it in until it
    melts. The sauce needs to be runny enough to percolate down
    through the veg and pasta to the meat underneath.
#### Finish the Dish
 9. Drain the pasta and add to the dish and cover with the sauce.
 10. Grate cheese over the top of the dish, grind some black pepper
     over it and sprinkle with oregano.
 11. Place in a hot oven, 200Â°C for about 20 minutes until the top is
     browned and the sauce is bubbling.
 12. Enjoy.
