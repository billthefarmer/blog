This soup is somewhat complicated to make, but delicious. Marrowfat peas need to be soaked overnight.

### Ingredients

 * Olive oil
 * 1/3 cup dried marrowfat peas
 * 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
 * 1/3 cup frozen or fresh peas
 * 1/2 cup chopped ham or bacon pieces
 * A medium sized onion, chopped finely
 * Two or three cloves of garlic, chopped
 * A stick of celery, chopped finely
 * A medium sized carrot, grated
 * 1/2 vegetable stock cube
 * Milk

### Method

 1. Soak the marrowfat peas overnight in a bowl of water with the 1/2
    teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.
 2. Discard the soaking water and rinse the marrowfat peas.
 3. Cover the bottom of a small saucepan with olive oil and place on a
    low heat. Add the onion and garlic and half the peas and marrowfat
    peas.
 4. Cover and allow to steam until the onion is soft.
 5. Scrape into a small bowl and zizz with a blender. This will make
    bright green sludge.
 6. Cover the bottom of the pan again with olive oil and add the
    bacon, if using. Place on a low heat.
 7. Allow the bacon to cook through before adding the celery, carrot,
    stock cube and the rest of the peas, or if using ham, add it last.
 8. Cover and allow to steam until the celery and carrot is soft.
 9. Add the green sludge from the bowl and cover with milk.
 10. Stir from time to time to prevent sticking and to prevent the
     milk from boiling until the marrowfat peas are soft. This may
     take up to 20 minutes.
 11. Serve with toast or crusty bread.
