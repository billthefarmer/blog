Many years ago one of my brothers' friends brought me a faulty
military surplus valve amplifier which used [807][1] valves for the
output. It appeared to have suffered a flashover which had destroyed
much of the wiring and components inside the chassis, but the
tagboards appeared to be reusable.

I had a copy of a Mullard amplifier book, Mullard Circuits for Audio
Amplifiers at the time, which I subsequently lent so someone who never
returned it. Just recently I found a copy [online][2].

So I stripped the amplifier and decided to rebuild it using the
[Mullard 5-20][3] design. There were the two [807][0] tetrode output
valves in push-pull, an [EF37A][4] pentode with a top cap for the
grid, an [ECC34][5] double triode, and a double diode rectifier
valve. Apart from the 807s this lined up with the Mullard design with
older octal valves instead of the newer B9A ones.

The mains transformer and output transformer had no markings, but I
was able to identify the connections by injecting from a 6.3V filament
transformer and connect them correctly.
