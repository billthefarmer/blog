Smart meters are not a new idea. I was a member of a project in 1983
which designed and rolled out a prototype smart meter which was far
ahead of it's time. The Unit was called a [CALMU][1] (Credit and Load
Management Unit). It was capable of recording electricity consumption
with several tariffs, gas consumption, with a connection to a suitable
gas meter and water use, with a connection to a suitable water meter.
