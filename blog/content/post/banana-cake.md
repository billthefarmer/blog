This cake is delicious, quick and easy to make.The amount of sugar is
reduced because the banana has natural sweetness. I have substituted
rapeseed oil for cooking margarine as it is a healthier option. Using
this method you do not need a food processor.

### Ingredients

  * 225g (8oz) self raising flour
  * 1 level teaspoon baking powder
  * 55g (2oz) demerara sugar
  * 2 large ripe bananas
  * 55g (2oz) walnut pieces
  * 55g (2oz) sultanas
  * 2 eggs
  * 2 tablespoons rapeseed oil
  * milk to mix


 &nbsp; 20cm cake tin (or similar)

### Method

 1. Sieve flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Add sugar. Cut
    bananas into small pieces and add to bowl.Add walnut pieces and
    sultanas and mix.
 2. Break eggs into a separate bowl and beat well. Add rapeseed oil to
    egg and beat again. Mix egg and oil mixture into dry ingredients
    carefully. Add sufficient milk to mixture so that it will drop
    from a metal spoon.
 3. Grease and flour cake tin and fill with the mixture. Bake for
    about 35 minutes at 180Â° centigrade.
