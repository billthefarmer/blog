This is from a transport caff near the village of Pissouri, Cyprus many years ago. The pods need to be picked before the beans have fully developed and before the pods have grown a tough membrane around the beans. I have not seen beans this young for sale.

## Ingredients

  * Young broad bean pods,
  * Olive oil

## Method

  1. Wash and trim the bean pods and put in a suitably sized saucepan
  2. Add a glug of olive oil, cover and place on a low heat for about 10 minutes or so
  3. The pods will become soft and possibly brown a little depending on the heat

The transport caff served a bowl of these as a meal in it&#8217;s own right. Absolutely delicious, the white pith in the pods completely dissolves.
