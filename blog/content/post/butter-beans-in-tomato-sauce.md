We have been offered this in many Greek tavernas, especially the ones
with what's on offer displayed in a glass counter. On a trip to
Alonnisos we saw big tins of these, called Gigantes, at the back of a
taverna/supermarket/cash & carry that seemed to stock everything.

### Ingredients

 * Tin of butter beans
 * Tin of chopped tomatoes
 * 2 cloves of garlic, chopped
 * 2 onions, chopped
 * Oregano
 * Olive oil

### Method

 1. Fry the onions, garlic and oregano in olive oil in a medium sized
   skillet until soft
 2. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes, stir, and allow to simmer gently.
 3. Drain the tin of butter beans and add to the pan.
 4. Simmer gently until heated through and serve in bowls
