This is similar to [Vegetables cooked in olive oil][1], except mashed
or whipped with a fork. Parsnips are difficult to grate, the softer
outer part can be peeled off with a vegetable peeler, and the harder
inner code sliced thinly.

### Ingredients

  * Sliced onions
  * Potatoes
  * Carrots
  * Parsnips/Swede/Turnips
  * Cabbage/Spinach
  * Olive oil

### Method

  1. Cover the bottom of a medium saucepan with oil
  2. Place a layer of sliced onions on the bottom
  3. Layer grated carrot, grated parsnip/turnip/swede, cubed potato
     and chopped cabbage/spinach.
  4. Put on a low heat for about 20 minutes with the lid on until the
     veg is cooked and the potatoes are soft.
  5. Mash or whip with a fork until smooth or lumpy to taste.
