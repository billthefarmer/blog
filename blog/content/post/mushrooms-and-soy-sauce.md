When I was working for the electric light company in Hove, many years
ago, the canteen ladies frequently served up, as part of a buffet,
sliced raw mushrooms in soy sauce. Tasty side dish with a salad or
buffet.

### Ingredients

 * Thinly sliced mushrooms
 * Dark soy sauce

### Method

 1. Thinly slice the mushrooms into a bowl
 2. Sprinkle over the soy sauce
 3. Leave for a while for the sauce to soak into and soften the
    mushrooms

I have not seen this elsewhere or online, so I assume that the canteen
ladies came up with the idea themselves.
