This is not authentic Risotto Milanese, that requires beef marrow and
saffron. I refuse to pay the exotic prices demanded for saffron in the
UK, and I don't have any beef marrow.

Lunch for two.

### Ingredients
 * Olive oil
 * Butter, small knob
 * 3/4 cup arborio rice
 * Medium onion, chopped finely
 * Mushrooms, chopped, if liked
 * Chicken stock pot
 * 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
 * Boiling water, about 1 1/4 cups
 * Cheddar cheese, grated
 
### Method
 1. Add the knob of butter to a medium heavy bottomed pan, add a
    good glug of olive oil and place on a low heat.
 2. Add the chopped onion and allow to cook until soft.
 3. Add the mushrooms, if using, rice, turmeric and stir to coat the rice.
 4. Add the stock pot and water, stirring to ensure the stock pot has
    melted and well stirred in.
 5. Cover and allow to cook until the rice is done and the water is
    nearly all absorbed.
 6. Stir in the grated cheese and leave to steam, covered, for a few minutes.
 
I added mushrooms because they were there, waiting to be used, and the
cheese was a small lump left in the packet.
