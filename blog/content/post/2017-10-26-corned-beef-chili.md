This is an instant meal ideal for taking as part of a grub kit on
holiday for when you arrive. I know you are not supposed to put red
beans in chili, but you never get offered it without. I know you are
supposed to make chili with chopped steak, not mince, let alone corned
beef. A meal for four.

### Ingredients

 * Tin of corned beef
 * Tin of red beans
 * Tin of chopped tomatoes
 * Packet of chili mix
 * Olive oil

### Method

 1. Warm up a large skillet over a gentle heat with some olive oil and
    add the corned beef, breaking it up into chunks
 2. When the corned beef has warmed through, add the chili mix and
    the tin of tomatoes
 3. Stir gently, drain the tin of red beans and add to the pan
 4. Allow to simmer, stirring to prevent sticking, until well heated
    through
 5. Meanwhile, cook a pot of boiled rice
 6. Serve with the rice and possibly some mango chutney
