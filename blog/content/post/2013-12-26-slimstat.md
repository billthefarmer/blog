When I first set up this web site, I looked for a simple web analytics program so that I could see if anyone actually looked at it. After faffing about with a couple of well known open source packages, I decided that they were way over the top by several orders of magnitude. Then I found [SlimStat][1]. However it appears to be no longer actively maintained, which it why the previous link is via the Way Back Machine. But it works just fine. It&#8217;s also on [Github][2] and [Google Code][3].

I have written a very minimal [plugin][4] to use it in WordPress.
