When I was a teenager the chippy at Preston, Weymouth, Dorset used to
serve faggots and peas with gravy in those aluminium foil containers
that take-away Chinese used to come in. Enough for 2.

### Ingredients

  * 3-5 faggots
  * Frozen or fresh peas
  * [Truly Evil Onion Gravy][1]

### Method

  1. Start the gravy first as it takes a while to render the onions down.
  2. Once the onions are well done, put the faggots in a tin and place
     in a medium hot oven &#8211; 180Â° C, until they are starting to
     brown.
  3. Cook the peas in accordance with the instructions. When they are
     done, use the cooking water for the gravy.
  4. Serve, pouring the gravy over the faggots and peas.
