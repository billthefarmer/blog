Another not so light lunch for two.

## Ingredients

  * Two largish onions
  * Four or five eggs, depending on size
  * Chorizo, sliced
  * Cheese, sliced
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  * Oil for cooking

## Method

  1. Warm up a large skillet or frying pan with some cooking oil in it.
  2. While the pan is warming slice the onions into rings and place in the pan.
  3. Whip up the eggs and grind some black pepper into them.
  4. When the onions are nicely browned, turn the slices over and pour over the eggs.
  5. Decorate with slices of chorizo and cheese.
  6. Pop under the grill to finish. Take care if the pan has a plastic or wooden handle.
  7. This may be difficult to get out of the in one piece, depending on how non stick your pan really is.
  8. Serve with crusty bread.
