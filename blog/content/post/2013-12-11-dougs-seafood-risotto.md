This is my interpretation of my brother&rsquo;s risotto. This is in no way a conventional risotto recipe, but it works nicely. Hearty dinner for four.

### Ingredients

  * 2 cups of risotto rice
  * Three or four onions, depending on size
  * Three cloves of garlic
  * A red pepper and a green pepper
  * A punnet of mushrooms, approx 200g
  * 350g approx of seafood selection
  * Freshly ground black pepper
  * Oregano
  * A chicken stockpot
  * Butter
  * Water
  * Olive oil

### Method

  1. Â Warm up a large saucepan with a good glug of olive oil in it.
  2. Chop up the vegetables and add to the pan.
  3. Sprinkle over a generous amount of oregano, a good grind of black pepper, put the lid on, and let it sweat for a while.
  4. Add the rice and the stockpot, give it a good shake and put the lid back on for a bit.
  5. Add about the same quantity of water as rice, or slightly less. Stir well. Do not add more, water as lots of liquid cooks out of the ingredients.
  6. Add the seafood when it begins to bubble.
  7. Let it simmer gently with an occasional stir to prevent sticking until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
  8. Add a generous lump of butter and stir in.
  9. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.
 10. Serve.
