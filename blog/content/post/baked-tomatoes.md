On a holiday staying at the [Atlantic Hotel][1], St Mary's there
seemed to be a different breakfast chef nearly every day. One of them
had a novel way of preparing tomatoes for an English breakfast.

### Ingredients
 * Tomatoes
 * Oregano
 * Olive oil

### Method
 1. Take the stems off the tomatoes and place them upside down in a
    baking tin. They should be stable upside down.
 2. Cut a cross in the bottom of each one, put a few drops of oil on
    each one and sprinkle over some oregano. The oregano sticks if you
    put the oil on first.
 3. Put the tin in a medium oven and bake until they are done.
 4. Serve with breakfast, sausages, pork chops or whatever you fancy.
