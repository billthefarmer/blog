Black onion gravy to go with faggots, sausages or whatever takes your fancy.

### Ingredients

  * 3 medium onions, sliced
  * 1 tablespoon plain flour or cornmeal (polenta)
  * 1/2 vegetable stock cube, crumbled
  * Boiling water or cooking water from vegetables
  * Vegetable oil

### Method

  1. Cover the bottom of a small pan with oil and place on medium heat.
  2. Put the onions in the pan and cook, stirring with a fork until
     reduced to brown/black sludge.
  3. Add flour/cornmeal and stock cube and continue to stir over the
     heat until combined.
  4. Turn down the heat and pour in the boiling water carefully. It
     will bubble violently and give off extremely hot steam.
  5. Keep stirring as it thickens and add more water if necessary.

If using with sausages, if the sausages are cooked in the oven in a
grill pan, pour off the fat when the sausages are done, pour the
vegetable water into the pan, try to get as much gunge off the bottom
of the pan as you can before pouring it into the gravy.
