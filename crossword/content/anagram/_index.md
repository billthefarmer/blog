Type in the word or phrase you want anagrams for, and use the keyboard
**Next** button or the **Search** button to search. The search may
take a long time, depending on the length of the phrase. During the
search the **Search** button is disabled. The anagram search uses a
smaller 58,000 word dictionary to reduce the search time, and because
the larger dictionary contains a large number of not very useful three
and four letter words and acronyms.

A list of anagrams will appear below, sorted in reverse order of
value, derived from Scrabble letter values. If you select an entry in
the list, the entry will be copied to the input field and a new screen
will show a web search for the definition of the entry on
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).

The results are ordered by an algorithm using Scrabble letter values to
hopefully get the more interesting anagrams to the top of the list. That
doesn't mean that some gems might not be hiding down the list.

This anagram algorithm is intended as a useful additional function to
the crossword clue search, but is in no way comprehensive. Use one of
the online anagram sites, such as [Wordsmith.org](https://wordsmith.org/anagram)
for a more comprehensive search.
