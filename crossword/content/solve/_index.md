Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
dropdown. If the number of slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the
phone so they will. The letter slots will scroll sideways. The longest
word in the dictionary is antidisestablishmentarianism, which is 28
letters.  Even if 28 slots won't fit on the screen, the app should
still find this word.

Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
the next slot will be selected and the app will search for words. You
can also use the the keyboard **Next** button or the **Search** button
to search. A stop character may be used as a wildcard.

A list of matching words will appear below. If you select a word in the
list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a web search
will be made for the definition on
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). You may select links on the page
and navigate back using the **Home** button on the toolbar.

There are three icons in the toolbar: **Anagram**, which will show the
anagram screen, **Help**, which will show the help screen, and
**About**, which will show the copyright, licence and version.

And on the menu, **Theme**, which will change the app theme.
On Android 6, Marshmallow, the theme will not change until you rotate
the device or restart the app. On other versions the theme will change
immediately. This is due to an issue with Android 6 which would
otherwise cause the app to crash.
