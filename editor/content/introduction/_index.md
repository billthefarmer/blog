This is a very simple generic text editor which may be used standalone
or to show or edit any sort of text file from another app. If you
select a text file in a file manager or similar app you will be
offered the option of using this editor along with whatever other apps
you have installed that can show or edit a text file. Files will
initially be opened read only, long touch on the display or touch the
edit item in the toolbar to enable editing.
