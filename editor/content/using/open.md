Choose a file to open from the chooser dialog that pops up. The file
will initially be read-only. Touch the Edit toolbar item to enable
editing.

The chooser shows a scrollable row of folder buttons and list of files
with icons. Files which appear to be media files, or are too large
will be disabled and not selectable. Touch a folder button or a folder
to change folder, or a file to open a file. Hidden files beginning
with a '.' will not appear.

The parent folder, if it exists, will appear first in the list. Touch
that folder to move up the directory tree. If a folder is not
accessible, the chooser will show the parent folder, if it exists, and
the external storage folder (`/storage/emulated/0`).

Use the **Storage** button to open files using the android file
manager. This should ensure that files on removeable SD cards can be
saved using the **Save** button. The file manager may refuse to open
some types of text files not recognised by android.
