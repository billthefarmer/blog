Choose a file to open from the chooser dialog that pops up. The parent
folder will be the first in the list. The file will initially be
read-only. Touch the Edit toolbar item to enable editing.

The chooser shows a list of files with icons. Files which appear to be
media files, or are too large will be disabled and not
selectable. Touch a folder to change folder, or a file to open a
file. Hidden files beginning with a '.' will not appear.

The parent folder, if it exists, will appear first in the list. Touch
that folder to move up the directory tree. If a folder is not
accessible, the chooser will show the parent folder, if it exists, and
the external storage folder (`/storage/emulated/0`).
