Text files opened or shared by another app may be viewed and
edited. Some apps may share files or text using a `content` URI that
is not resolvable to a path to a file in storage. In that case the
editor will read the file into the default file. The default file in
storage will not be overwritten unless the file is saved. Use the
**Save as** menu item to save the file elsewhere.
