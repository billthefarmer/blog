Text files opened or shared by another app may be viewed and
edited. Some apps may share files or text using a `content` URI that
is not resolvable to a path to a file in storage. In that case the
editor will read the file into a new file. The **Save** item will save
the file in the original location if possible.

**Note** &ndash; Apps that share files will usually only give another
app read permission. Use the **Save as** menu item to save the file
elsewhere.
