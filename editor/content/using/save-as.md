Enter a new file name in the dialog that pops up. Absolute names
starting with a slash '/' will be saved in that exact path. Names
without a starting slash will be saved relative to the main public
folder, `/sdcard/`, or `/storage/emulated/0/`. Touch the **Storage**
button to use the android file manager to save the file.
