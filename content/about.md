Playing at Oldland Mill, near Ditchling.

I am retired, a morris musician and an itinerant developer. I was a chartered electrical engineer until I stopped paying for a journal I couldn&#8217;t understand. Over the course of a long career working for the local electrick light company I developed various bits and pieces of software in so many different languages I can no longer remember them all. In rough order they are:

   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---
6800 assembler|DEC Macro|Fortran|6502 assembler|Basic, various flavours
Forth|8051 assembler|BCPL|Lisp|C
PL1|IBM JCL|68000 assembler|Java|[Smallworld Magik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magik_%28programming_language%29)
JavaScript|haXe|PHP|Python|C++

Lately I have written various Android apps and a WordPress plugin. I play music for the [Old Shoreham Buccaneers](http://billthefarmer.users.sourceforge.net/buccaneers") morris side, and also occasionally take part in local pub music sessions. Unlike just about every other local musician I know, I&#8217;m not in a ceilidh band. I hate ceilidhs.
