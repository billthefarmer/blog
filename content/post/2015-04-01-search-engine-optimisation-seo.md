I haven&#8217;t worried too much about search engines since I set this site up. I registered it with Google initially, and after a few days it appeared in the results, so that was good enough for me. If you search for Old Shoreham Buccaneers, or a subset of that, the Buccaneers site appears high in the results, job done.

Since I published a <a href="http://billthefarmer.users.sourceforge.net/wordpress/sausages-with-green-lentils" target="_blank">recipe</a> based on the BBC TV programme <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03pn297" target="_blank">Italy Unpacked </a>about a month ago, I have been getting a lot of hits on the <a href="http://billthefarmer.users.sourceforge.net/wordpress/category/recipes" target="_blank">Recipes</a> page. When I finally got around to checking I found that this is due to it being the only actual recipe directly attributed to the show in the search results. It&#8217;s <del>currently fourth</del> now second in the listing if you search for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=sausage%20and%20lentils%20recipe%20Italy%20Unpacked" target="_blank">sausage and lentils recipe Italy Unpacked</a> on Google.

What that says to me is: **Content Content Content**.
