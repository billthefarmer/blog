This is an adaptation of a recipe I saw recently in the [Metro][1]. Not Huevos Rancheros, but something else. The original recipe was most insistent that the black pepper be added to the pan, not the eggs, and the eggs should be stirred, not beaten.

## Ingredients

  * Small potato, chopped
  * Small onion, chopped
  * Chili pepper, sliced
  * Chorizo, chopped
  * Tomato, chopped
  * Fresh ground black pepper
  * 2 eggs
  * Oil

## Method

  1. Put some oil in a medium sized skillet or frying pan and warm up.
  2. Add the potatoes, chili, onion, and chorizo, put a lid on, and allow to cook gently until the potatoes and onion are cooked through.
  3. Add the tomato, give a stir and shake to loosen up any stuck on potato, grind over some black pepper, and put the lid back on until the tomato is heated through.
  4. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a suitable container and stir until they are well mixed.
  5. Pour the eggs over the mixture in the pan, and stir and shake to ensure the eggs have penetrated under the mixture.
  6. Put the lid back on and cook gently until the egg is cooked through.
  7. If you are a wizard with an extremely non-stick pan you might be able to get this on to a plate in one piece. Otherwise, just pile it on.
