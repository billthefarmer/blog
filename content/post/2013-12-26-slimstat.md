When I first set up this web site, I looked for a simple web analytics program so that I could see if anyone actually looked at it. After faffing about with a couple of well known open source packages, I decided that they were way over the top by several orders of magnitude. Then I found [SlimStat](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012925/http://slimstat.net). However it appears to be no longer actively maintained, which it why the previous link is via the Way Back Machine. But it works just fine. It&#8217;s also on [Github](https://github.com/stephenwettone/slimstat) and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/slimstat).

I have written a very minimal [plugin](https://github.com/billthefarmer/wordpress-slimstat) to use it in WordPress.
