<p class="western">
  This recipe is based on the sausages with lentils in this episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b053gkm6/italy-unpacked-series-3-2-to-the-centre-of-the-earth" target="_blank">Italy Unpacked</a> on BBC 2. This is enough for three or four, depending on the number of sausages. You will need a medium sized pan to cook the lentils, and a large deep pan for the sausages, onions, and everything else.

# Ingredients {.western}

  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">One cup green lentils</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Two sticks celery, chopped</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Large garlic clove or two small, chopped<br /> </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Six or eight good quality sausages</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Two large onions, chopped</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">500g carton passata</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Olive oil</span>

## Method {.western}

  1. Put lentils, chopped celery and garlic in a pot, cover with water, boil for five minutes, then simmer for about 30 minutes until tender. Add more water if necessary. The idea is for the lentils to absorb all the water.
  2. Fry sausages in a deep pan until nearly done.
  3. Remove sausages and replace with chopped onions.
  4. Fry the onions until golden, stir to release the bits of burnt on sausage.
  5. Add passata and heat through, stirring.
  6. Replace sausages, add lentils.
  7. Cook gently until done, add some olive oil before serving.
