This is a nice snack for two.

## Ingredients

  * Two eggs
  * Sliced chorizo or crispy bacon
  * Four slices of bread
  * Tomato thinly sliced
  * Cheese sliced

## Method

  1. Toast two slices of bread and fry two eggs
  2. Meanwhile slice the tomato thinly
  3. Flip the eggs, otherwise the tomato won&#8217;t stay on top
  4. Layer chorizo slices, egg, tomato slices and cheese slices on each piece of toast
  5. Put the toast slices on heatproof plates and put under a hot grill to melt the cheese
  6. Toast the other two slices of bread
  7. When the cheese is melted take the plates out and press down the other slices of toast on top
  8. Slice the sandwiches in two diagonally
