The app will ask for location and file access permissions. The
location permission is to find out where you are. The file access
permission is so the mapping function can cache map tiles. If map
tiles are cached, there is a limited amount of mapping available
without internet access, otherwise map tiles will be downloaded every
time the app is used.
