The app widget will show the bus times from the last stop viewed. The
widget will update periodically for about 5 minutes. Tap the refresh
button to update again. Due to restrictions in later versions of
android the refresh button will no longer work after a short
period. Tap the widget anywhere to show the app. The widget will
update when the app is dismissed and the refresh button will work
again.
