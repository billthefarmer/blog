The map shows a person icon in a blue shaded circle. The size of the
circle indicates the accuracy of the location. If the app thinks you
are moving, the person icon is replaced by an arrow. The current time
and date, OS six figure reference, and OS twelve figure reference are
shown in the left upper corner of the map. The current longitude,
latitude, altitude and accuracy are shown in the right upper corner of
the map. If the map is panned, these figures will change to the
current map centre. After a delay they will revert to the current GPS
location.
